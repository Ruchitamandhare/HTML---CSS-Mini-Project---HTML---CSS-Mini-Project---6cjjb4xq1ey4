      <h2>Jantar Mantar, Jaipur
    </h2>
      <p>
        The Jantar Mantar in Jaipur is an astronomical observation site dating back to the early 18th century. This is the most significant, most comprehensive, and the best-preserved historic observatories in India. An observatory has a different language of architecture; more technical than being fancy. The equipment and their placement play a vital role in the design of a building of this kind. It would be interesting to study how the structure of this character would be designed today with the techniques and materials available

      <h2>Information Hawa Mahal</h2>
      <p>
        Now, this is an architectural marvel. The Hawa Mahal. or Breeze Palace, boasts an interesting honeycombed five-storey facade with 953 peep windows. It was constructed in 1799 from pink sandstone and built in the form of Krishna, the Hindu God’s crown. 

        The beautifully carved windows allow a breeze to blow through the palace, giving way to its nickname. It is claimed that these windows, that are the size of a peephole, served a second purpose. They were used by royal ladies to enjoy the everyday street scenes without being noticed.
        
        Interestingly, the Hawa Mahal is the tallest building in the world without any foundation. More so, there isn’t any door in the front. The palace can be entered from behind and, in contrast to the rich decoration of the exterior, the interiors are much simpler.
